# cpp-language
Testing out C++ language features: Covers C++98, C++11, C++14 and C++17. Currently master branch is C++11 code.

This repo contains simple C++ programs that demonstrate a single language feature.
Some programs will deliberately fail at runtime because they are demonstrating problems that can occur in C++ code.
