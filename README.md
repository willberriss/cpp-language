# cpp-language
Testing out C++ language features: Covers C++98, C++11, C++14 and C++17. 

Current work on dev branch is mainly C++11 code.

This repo contains simple C++ programs that demonstrate a single language feature.
Some programs will deliberately fail at runtime because they are demonstrating problems that can occur in C++ code.

I don't have a c++17 compiler currently.
